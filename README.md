# HelloWorld

This is a simple app created with vanilla javaScript, HTML, and CSS. I made it between more demanding projects to play around with vanilla JS after spending a lot of time with React. I tried to do everything as manually as possible (without additional libraries or plugins) to refamiliarize myself with DOM manipulation.
